📱 How to Run Centsible on Mobile

1. Open this zip on your phone using a file manager app (like Files or Files by Google).
2. Extract the folder.
3. Open the folder and tap `index.html` — it should launch in your browser.
4. In Safari or Chrome, tap the Share icon and choose “Add to Home Screen” to install it like an app.
5. Done! You now have a working Centsible demo on your home screen.

If it doesn’t load properly, let me know — we can set up GitHub Pages for full support.
